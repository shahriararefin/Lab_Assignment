/*
Suppose you want to declare an array of size 15 and the elements of the array will be in a geometric progression, the first one starting with 1 and the common ratio being 
2. For example, the first few elements of that array will be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 , â€¦ and so on. Write a for loop to initialize the array with the  required progression.
